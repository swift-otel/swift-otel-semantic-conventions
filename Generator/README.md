This is a utility package to generate swift-otel-semantic-conventions files. It is implemented as a completely different Swift package in order to avoid mixing its depenendencies with that of the main package.

To use it, enter this directory in a terminal and run:

```
swift run Generator --version v1.29.0
```

The version can be varied to generate for different versions of the otel semantic conventions.

For a full description of the options, run:

```
swift run Generator --help
```
